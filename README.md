This EFI is supposed to be embedded for macOS Big Sur deployment on a Lenovo Z40-70 IdeaPad. It is a partition on a data storage that is used by the Z40-70 that has the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). When the Z40-70 is booted, UEFI firmware loads files stored on the ESP (EFI System Partition) to start installed operating systems and various utilities.

Warning.  
It is just for educational purpose only. Do not use for any other purpose.

Disclaimer.  
I'm not responsible for any damage resulted from an improper deployment and any practice whatsoever.
